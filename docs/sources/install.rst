Installation
------------

The fritzconnection package is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_ and installable by `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_  ::

    $ pip install fritzconnection

This installation will also install the required package `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_. If this does not work (for whatever reason) this can can also get installed by pip: ::

    $ pip install requests

It is not necessary, but good practice, to do the installation in a virtual environment â€“ either by means of `venv <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html?highlight=venv#module-venv>`_ or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ (comes with `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ or `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_).

fritzconnection runs with Python 3.6 or newer (older versions are not supported).
